/*
User

The User class is straightforward. It keeps track of a user's 
first and last names; email address; and age, as one would expect. 
The only application-specific field is targetAdherence. 
If we imagine that people use this application to improve their eating habits and eat more complete meals, targetAdherence represents their goal for healthy eating â€” i.e., what percentage of their meals they want to be complete.

For example, my goal might be to get to a point where nine out of every ten meals I eat are "complete." In that case, my targetAdherence would be 90.
